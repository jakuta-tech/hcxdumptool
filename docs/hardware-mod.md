# Hardware Modification - See /docs For More Info

When using this hardware modification, the LED will flash every 10 seconds if everything is fine and signals are received correctly.

To terminate manually, press the push button for at least 10 seconds until LED turns on. (The LED will also turn on if hcxdumptool terminates.)

Afterwards, the Raspberry Pi can be turned off and disconnected from it's power supply.
